<p>Identify 2 urban transformations 
Climate resilient city Amsterdam (pp 32-37)
Central Station Sydney

Urban transformation definition
Urban Transformation is the constant renewal and reshaping of an urban environment in order to overcome societal and environmental issues, in turn creating a more connected and liveable community. 

Urban: in, relating to, or characteristic of a town or city.
Transformation: a marked change in form, nature, or appearance.
“People Continuously Reshaping Environments Based On Their Current Demands.” https://www.idc-online.com/technical_references/pdfs/civil_engineering/Urban%20Transformation.pdf 

How do they meet our definition AND Describe the transformation.
Central
$955 million renewal
Aim for the renewal to be the “catalyst that revitalises and anchors urban transformation to the south of the Sydney CBD.”
To cater for the expected 450,000 extra people travelling within the next 2 decades
Main project features include: 
Construction of Central Walk – a 19-metre-wide tunnel from Chalmers Street, linking to new metro platforms under Central Station
Construction of a new world-class metro station
Renewal of the historic Central Station
A new feature roof to the Northern Concourse that will transform the space and emphasise the historic features of the Central Electric Building 
The excavation and construction of the new underground Sydney Metro platforms at Central beneath platforms 13 and 14;
Central Walk – a new 19-metre wide underground concourse from Chalmers Street, connecting customers to suburban rail platforms, Sydney Metro platforms, the new light rail and buses; 
For the first time, customers will be able to use escalators to get to platforms 12 to 23; 
Completion of the Central Walk and Central Station metro upgrade contract is expected in 2022, with Central Walk open to customers.

Amsterdam: 
Making the urban area more resistant to flooding from rainfall and longer periods of heat and drought 
Addresses the fact that climate is changing in the urban environment due to global warming, addressing the outcomes of global warming on the urban environment, accepting these changes and taking them into account in the design of the urban areas. 
Ways this is being done is by:
Analysing the water and climate resilience of the planning area
Translating the results of this analysis into a strategy with targets
Implementing the policy and legal impact of this ambition


Briefly and to the pointly explain, using diagrams, the ‘key moves’ in the transformation and the reasons they were made.
CENTRAL:
Create centres of activity around stations
 give the local community access day-to-day to community services and employment right near the stations – with shops, services, cultural places and work environments promoting activity in public areas that are safe day and night 
Create connections across the railway corridor for walking and cycling
the rail corridor would be less of a barrier for pedestrians and cyclists – making it easier to connect across neighbourhoods. Community and education facilities could become more accessible to all the communities. (https://centraltoeveleigh.nsw.gov.au/assets/Publications/C2E-UTS-21112016.pdf p.46) 
Create a green network
 green network in a busy area of Sydney would encourage people to get active and enjoy connected public open spaces, all networked around green, leafy and more attractive streets. This would support pedestrian and cycling networks and provide fresh places to take a break, be active or join events and gatherings. The green network is more than just green streets – it also includes initiatives for greener building facades and rooftops. Access and potentially the delivery of water recycling schemes is also considered in this key move. (https://centraltoeveleigh.nsw.gov.au/assets/Publications/C2E-UTS-21112016.pdf p.45) 
Connect the city with surrounding places
Cleaner, safer and more attractive streets could be complemented by walking and cycling paths, making it easier and safer for more people to move around (https://centraltoeveleigh.nsw.gov.au/assets/Publications/C2E-UTS-21112016.pdf p.47)


Explain how the success of the transformation might be assessed and what data might be needed to assess it.

Identify groups that were in favour of the transformation and those who were opposed.

Identify the arguments made by different groups.
